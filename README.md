## Introduction 📌

Social media is one of those places where today's youth spend most of their time. It is a place where they interact with people and do multiple things.

I have tried creating this social media app UI which is from a social media app called Sushy where users can post, message and do different things.

**This project is only the UI part.**

## Technology Stack 🏁

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)

## Why this Project? 🏃‍♂️

My main goal behind creating this project was creating an interactive UI keeping the screen sizes in mind. I have implemented a flutter dependency In-App which provides an ability for changing the screen sizes on the go.

The interface of the app is simple yet elegant with the color scheme of pink and multiple shades of grey.

For this project, i have worked on various domains like:

- UI/UX Development with Flutter 
- Image Capturing with Camera
- Resizing elements according to different screen size
- Testing feature:-In-App screen size changer
